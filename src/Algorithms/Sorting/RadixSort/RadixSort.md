# RadixSort
RadixSort is a non-comparative, stable sorting algorithm. Comparisons are substituted by 
placing elements into so called buckets based on their radix (digits).

## The algorithm


## LSD vs. MSD
LSD (least significant digit) first focuses on the last digit in the element.
e.g. in `1234` this would be `4`

MSD (most significant digit) is unsurprinsingly the opposite of LSD where the first 
digit is considered first
