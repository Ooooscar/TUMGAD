\textbf{\LARGE{\color{tumgadRed}APSP / Floyd-Warshall Algorithm}}\\
\\
\noindent
Given the following directed graph:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        > = stealth', % arrow head style
        auto,
        node distance = 6cm, % distance between nodes
        semithick % line style
    ]
        \node[state] (a) {a};
        \node[state] (b) [right of=a] {b};
        \node[state] (c) [below of=b] {c};
        \node[state] (d) [below of=a] {d};

        %$EDGES$
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Follow the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for APSP and enter the node distance matrix after each step.\\
Assume the algorithm continues with the next element lexicographically.\\
As always, unknown distances should be abstracted as infinity.\\
