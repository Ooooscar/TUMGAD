The size of a hashtable is set to $m = HCTABLESIZE$.\\
The following operations are to be executed:
\begin{center}
    Insert: $INSERTIONS$\\
\end{center}
Use the following hash function:\\
\begin{center}
    $NORMALFUNCTION$\\
\end{center}
a) Compute the values to which each one of the above numbers map to and enter them into this table:
\begin{center}
    $MAPPINGTABLESOLUTION$
\end{center}
b) Execute the operations above in their given order and enter them into the hashtable preprints.\\
