# TUMGAD
Exercise generation and helpful materials for the course Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures
## About
TUMGAD is a tool for anyone wanting to learn about the foundations of Algorithms and Data Structures, though it 
was mainly developed for Students of the Technical University of Munich [https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=452818](Course IN0007).

Furthermore it was created using Lecture Resources of the TUM provided in the summer
semester of 2019 and 2020 as well as the Book [Algorithms and Data Structures: The Basic Toolbox](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540779773).
Hence there may be different definitions in this project than you are used to.
